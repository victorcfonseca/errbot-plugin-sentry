# errbot-plugin-sentry

#sentry #github #errbot #slack

This plugin is designed to be run inside a bot based on errbot and installed in your Slack workspace. Its main function is to create a new project in [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) based on input from a requester. In addition, it also adds the Guthub repository if you have Sentry x Github integration.

## How its works?
As with all [other plugins](https://github.com/topics/errbot-plugins), the 'sentry.plug' and 'sentry.py' files must be placed inside the errbot's /plugins directory.
